This program loads an MP4 video file of a car driving on a traffic road from the first perspective on the RB1 device. Each frame of video data is recognized and processed using the road recognition AI algorithm, and a processed AVI video file is output. The video accurately depicts the traffic lines on both sides of the current vehicle's road. In order to verify the algorithm's processing effect, the original video and the processed video files are provided separately in the project.
